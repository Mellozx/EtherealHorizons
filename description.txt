Ethereal Horizons is a new work in progress mod, aiming to add in-game some 
new unique mechanics, with a fun, balanced gameplay! Our goal is mostly just to 
enhance the game with our own content, expanding it on multiple areas and overhauling 
a few of vanilla content. 

This version contains really small content so far, but dont worry, we will be
gradually working on new updates. There is way more content to come :)

We do appreciate any kind of constructive criticism, so 
feel free to give us some! (Preferably on our Discord Server, link can be found on
the forum thread).
